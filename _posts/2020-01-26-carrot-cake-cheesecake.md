    1. Preheat the oven to 180˚C.
    2. Make the carrot cake: Shred carrots by hand or in a food processor, then set aside in a small bowl.
    3. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, powdered sugar, and eggs and whisk until smooth.
    4. Add the oil and whisk to combine.
    5. Add the vanilla, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and shredded carrots and stir with a spatula to combine.
    6. Make the cheesecake: In a separate large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and powdered sugar until smooth.
    7. Whisk in the eggs, 1 at a time. Add the vanilla and sour cream and whisk until well blended.
    8. Pour ¾ of the carrot cake batter into a greased 8-inch springform pan and smooth the top. Add ½ of the cheesecake batter, then the rest of the carrot cake batter and cheesecake batter.
    9. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate for 4 hours, or overnight.
    10. Release from the springform, then slice and serve.
